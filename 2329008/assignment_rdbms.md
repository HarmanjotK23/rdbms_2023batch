# <p align="center">DEFINITON OF COMMANDS</p>
### In the context of databases, DDL, DML, and DCL are abbreviations for different types of SQL (Structured Query Language) commands used to interact with databases. These commands are crucial for managing, querying, and controlling access to the data stored in a database.<br>

| Concerned with defining, altering, or dropping the structure of the database and its objects (e.g., tables, indexes, views)    | Focused on manipulating and querying the data within the database (e.g., inserting, updating, deleting, selecting records).    | Primarily involved in controlling access to data by granting or revoking permissions and privileges (e.g., granting select privileges to a user).  |
| Involves actions that change the structure of the database, such as creating, modifying, or deleting database objects.   |  Involves actions that manipulate or interact with the data stored in the database, including insertion, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data.    | Focuses on actions related to access control and permissions, such as granting or revoking privileges to users or roles.      |
| Examples include CREATE (create a new table), ALTER (modify a table structure), DROP (remove a table), and TRUNCATE (remove all records from a table).   |  Examples include SELECT (retrieve data), INSERT (add new records), UPDATE (modify existing records), and DELETE (remove records). | Examples include GRANT (give privileges to a user), REVOKE (withdraw privileges from a user), and DENY (explicitly deny access to a user).      |
| Impacts the structure of the database by creating, altering, or removing objects like tables, views, or indexes.   |   Impacts the data within the database by manipulating, querying, or retrieving records from the tables. | Impacts the access and security of the database by granting or revoking permissions and privileges to users or roles.     |
|Typically used by database administrators and developers to define and manage the database structure.  |   Commonly used by application developers and end-users to manipulate and query data. | Primarily used by database administrators to control access and ensure security within the database system.    |
